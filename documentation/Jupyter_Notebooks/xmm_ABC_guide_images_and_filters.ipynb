    "#### Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial is based on Chapter 6 from the [The XMM-Newton ABC Guide](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/abc/ \"ABC Guide\") prepared by the NASA/GSFC XMM-Newton Guest Observer Facility. This notebook assumes you are using the version of pySAS found on [GitHub](https://github.com/XMMGOF/pysas) and have already configured it to work with your SAS installation (see the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/XMMGOF/pysas/blob/main/README.md)). \n",
    "#### Expected Outcome\n",
    "The ability to apply basic filters to any XMM-Newton observation and prepare it for analysis.\n",

    "To begin we apply a standard filter. The filtering expressions for the MOS and PN are, respectively:\n",

    "(PATTERN $<=$ 12)&&(PI in [200:12000])&&#XMMEA_EM\n",
    "```\n",
    "and\n",
    "```\n",
    "(PATTERN $<=$ 4)&&(PI in [200:15000])&&#XMMEA_EP\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first two expressions will select good events with `PATTERN` in the 0 to 12 (or 0 to 4) range. The `PATTERN` value is similar the `GRADE` selection for ASCA data, and is related to the number and pattern of the CCD pixels triggered for a given event. The `PATTERN` assignments are: single pixel events: `PATTERN == 0`, double pixel events: `PATTERN in [1:4]`, triple and quadruple events: `PATTERN in [5:12]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second keyword in the expressions, `PI`, selects the preferred pulse height of the event; for the MOS, this should be between 200 and 12000 eV. For the PN, this should be between 200 and 15000 eV. This should clean up the image significantly with most of the rest of the obvious contamination due to low pulse height events. Setting the lower `PI` channel limit somewhat higher (e.g., to 300 eV) will eliminate much of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `#XMMEA_EM` (`#XMMEA_EP` for the PN) filter provides a canned screening set of `FLAG` values for the event. The `FLAG` value provides a bit encoding of various event conditions, e.g., near hot pixels or outside of the field of view. Setting `FLAG == 0` in the selection expression provides the most conservative screening criteria and should always be used when serious spectral analysis is to be done on the PN. It typically is not necessary for the MOS.\n",

    "It is a good idea to keep the output filtered event files and use them in your analyses, as opposed to re-filtering the original file with every task.

    "Alternatively, we could have chosen to make a new GTI file by noting the times of the flaring in the light curve and using that as a filtering parameter. The big flare starts around 7.32276e7 s, and the smaller ones are at 7.32119e7 s and 7.32205e7 s. The expression to remove these would be `(TIME <= 73227600)&&!(TIME IN [7.32118e7:7.3212e7])&&!(TIME IN [7.32204e7:7.32206e7])`. The syntax `(TIME <= 73227600)` includes only events with times less than or equal to `73227600`, and the \"!\" symbol stands for the logical \"not\", so use `&&!(TIME in [7.32118e7:7.3212e7])` to exclude events in that time interval.
