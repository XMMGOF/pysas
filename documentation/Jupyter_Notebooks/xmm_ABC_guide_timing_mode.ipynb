    "This tutorial is based on Chapter 8 from the [The XMM-Newton ABC Guide](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/abc/ \"ABC Guide\") prepared by the NASA/GSFC XMM-Newton Guest Observer Facility. This notebook assumes you are using the version of pySAS found on [GitHub](https://github.com/XMMGOF/pysas) and have already configured it to work with your SAS installation (see the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/XMMGOF/pysas/blob/main/README.md)). \n",

    "For the background, the extraction area should be as far from the source as possible. However, sources with > 200 ct/s (like our example!) are so bright that they dominate the entire CCD area, and there is no source-free region from which to extract a background. (It goes without saying that this is highly energy-dependent.) In such a case, it may be best not to subtract a background. Users are referred to Ng et al. (2010, A&A, 522, 96) for an in-depth discussion. While this observation is too bright to have a good background extraction region, the process is shown below nonetheless for the sake of demonstration:"

    "A few words about interpretting the plots are in order. The top is the distribution of counts versus PI channel for each pattern class (single, double, triple, quadruple), and the bottom is the expected pattern distribution (smooth lines) plotted over the observed distribution (line with noise). The lower plot shows the model distributions for single and double events and the observed distributions. It also gives the ratio of observed-to-modeled events with $1-\\sigma$ uncertainties for single and double pattern events over a given energy range. (The default is 0.5-2.0 keV; this can be changed with the `pileupnumberenergyrange` parameter.) If the data is not piled up, there will be good agreement between the modeled and observed single and double event pattern distributions. Also, the observed-to-modeled fractions for both singles and doubles in the 0.5-2.0 keV range will be unity, within errors. In contrast, if the data is piled up, there will be clear divergence between the modeled and observed pattern distributions, and the observed-to-modeled fraction for singles will be less than 1.0, and for doubles, it will be greater than 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when examining the plots, it should noted that the observed-to-modeled fractions can be inaccurate. Therefore, the agreement between the modeled and observed single and double event pattern distributions should be the main factor in determining if an observation is affected by pile up or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the plots, we see that there is a large difference between the modeled and observed single and double pattern events at $> 1.0$ keV, but this divergence is not reflected in the observed-to-model fractions since for singles it is $> 1.0$ with $1.011\\pm 0.001$, and for doubles it is $<1.0$ with $0.977\\pm 0.001$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the pile up we need to extend the energy range for the observed-to-model fraction calculations. The default is $500-2000$ eV. Let us set the range to $1000-5000$ eV."
