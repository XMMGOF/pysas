    "This tutorial is based on Chapter 10 from the [The XMM-Newton ABC Guide](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/abc/ \"ABC Guide\") prepared by the NASA/GSFC XMM-Newton Guest Observer Facility. This notebook assumes you are using the version of pySAS found on [GitHub](https://github.com/XMMGOF/pysas) and have already configured it to work with your SAS installation (see the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/XMMGOF/pysas/blob/main/README.md)). \n",

If this falls on an extraction region, the current energy calibration will require a wavelength-dependent zero-offset. Stray light can be detected on RGS DIAGNOSTIC images taken before, during and after the observation. This test, and the offset correction, are not performed on the data before delivery. Please note that this will not work in every case. If a source is very bright, the diagnostic data that this relies on may not have been downloaded from the telescope in order to save bandwidth. Also, the RGS target itself cannot be the source of optical photons, as the spectrum's zero-order falls far from the RGS chip array.
