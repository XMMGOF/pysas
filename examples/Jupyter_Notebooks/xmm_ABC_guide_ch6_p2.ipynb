    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial is based on Chapter 6 from the The XMM-Newton ABC Guide prepared by the NASA/GSFC XMM-Newton Guest Observer Facility. This notebook assumes you are using the version of pySAS found on [GitHub](https://github.com/XMMGOF/pysas) and have already configured it to work with your SAS installation (see the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/XMMGOF/pysas/blob/main/README.md)). \n",
    "#### Expected Outcome\n",
    "The ability to run source detection, spectra extraction, check for pile up, and preparing the spectra for analysis by creating a redistribution matrix file (RMF) and an ancillary response file (ARF).\n",

It can process up to three intruments (both MOS cameras and the PN) with up to five images in different energy bands simultaneously. All images must have identical binning and WCS keywords. For this example, we will perform source detection on MOS1 images in two bands (\"soft\" X-rays with energies between 300 and 2000 eV, and \"hard\" X-rays, with energies between 2000 and 10000 eV) using the filtered event files produced here.\n",

    "Throughout the following, please keep in mind that some parameters are instrument-dependent. The parameter `specchannelmax` should be set to 11999 for the MOS, or 20479 for the PN. Also, for the PN, the most stringent filters, `(FLAG==0)&&(PATTERN<=4)`, must be included in the expression to get a high-quality spectrum.\r\n",

    "For the MOS, the standard filters should be appropriate for many cases, though there are some instances where tightening the selection requirements might be needed. For example, if obtaining the best-possible spectral resolution is critical to your work, and the corresponding loss of counts is not important, only the single pixel events should be selected `(PATTERN==0)`. If your observation is of a bright source, you again might want to select only the single pixel events to mitigate pile up (see §6.8 and §6.9 for a more detailed discussion).\r\n",

The circle's radius can be changed by clicking on it and dragging to the desired size. Adjust the size and position of the circle until you are satisfied with the extraction region; then, double-click on the region to bring up a window showing the center coordinates and radius of the circle. For this example, we will choose the source at (26188.5,22816.5) and set the extraction radius to 300 (in physical units). `expression='((X,Y) in CIRCLE(26188.5,22816.5,300))'`\r\n",

    "A few words about interpretting the plots are in order. The top is the distribution of counts versus PI channel for each pattern class (single, double, triple, quadruple), and the bottom is the expected pattern distribution (smooth lines) plotted over the observed distribution (histogram). The lower plot shows the model distributions for single and double events and the observed distributions. It also gives the ratio of observed-to-modeled events with 1-$\\sigma$ uncertainties for single and double pattern events over a given energy range. (The default is 0.5-2.0 keV; this can be changed with the pileupnumberenergyrange parameter.) If the data is not piled up, there will be good agreement between the modeled and observed single and double event pattern distributions. Also, the observed-to-modeled fractions for both singles and doubles in the 0.5-2.0 keV range will be unity, within errors. In contrast, if the data is piled up, there will be clear divergence between the modeled and observed pattern distributions, and the observed-to-modeled fraction for singles will be less than 1.0, and for doubles, it will be greater than 1.0.\n",

Note that the observed-to-model fraction for doubles is over 1.0, and there is severe divergence between the model and the observed pattern distribution."

    "If you're working with a different (much brighter) dataset that does show signs of pile up, there are a few ways to deal with it. First, using the region selection and event file filtering procedures demonstrated in earlier sections, you can excise the inner-most regions of a source (as they are the most heavily piled up), re-extract the spectrum, and continue your analysis on the excised event file. For this procedure, it is recommended that you take an iterative approach: remove an inner region, extract a spectrum, check with epatplot, and repeat, each time removing a slightly larger region, until the model and observed distribution functions agree. If you do this, be aware that removing too small a region with respect to the instrumental pixel size (1.1'' for the MOS, 4.1'' for the PN) can introduce systematic inaccuracies when calculating the source flux; these are less than 4%, and decrease to less than 1% when the excised region is more than 5 times the instrumental pixel half-size. In any case, be certain that the excised region is larger than the instrumental pixel size!\n",
