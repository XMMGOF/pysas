ChangeLog for pysas
=================

Version 2.0 - 2025-??-?? (RT)
---------------
+ pysaspkgs : List of callable pysas packages. Previously pkgutil.walk_packages was used,
              but there were bugs with this and the list of packages returned didn't match 
              the list of actual packages. The list of packages is now read in using 
              importlib.resources.

- runtask.py: File has been removed and all functionality has been transferred to 
	            sastask.py. It only added an extra layer to the process.

+ sastask.py: The class SASTask has been deprecated since it was only an abstract class, 
	            with only abstract methods and a single child, MyTask. MyTask was the only 
	            class used in the rest of the code. To simplify things, MyTask has been 
	            made the only useful class, but SASTask is declared as a child of MyTask
              for legacy purposes, until all references to it can be removed.

	            Functionality from runtask has been placed in the 'run' method in MyTask.
              The method 'runtask' has been kept as a place holder for legacy code. It 
              just calls 'run'.

- wrapper.py: The Wrapper class has been deprecated since its only function was to create 
              a MyTask object. It has been left in place until legacy code can be switched
              over to MyTask.

+ logger.py : The logging module 'loguru' has been added with a function 'get_logger'. This
              returns a loguru logger object with options to output to the terminal (default)
              and/or to a log file. The user typically does not interact directly with the 
              'get_logger' function, but through the MyTask object which accepts all 
              necessary inputs.

	            The user can declare a directory for the log files, or even a single log file
              for all output from all SAS tasks called.

+ version.py: At the top level version.py only contains the version information for pySAS.
              For independent tasks they maintain their own version numbers, but for all
              other subdirectories they all point to the master pySAS version file.

	            get_sas_version dedicated function to run 'sasversion' and get SAS version 
              information.

+ */version.py: All version files for individual SAS tasks now only contain their version
                information.

	            Justification: Each individual Python based task should not keep track of 
	            which SAS version it was compiled with 

+ print_version.py: Replaces 'sasver'. SAS version information can now be printed using
                    pysas.print_sas_version()

- sasver    : Subdirectory has been removed. All functionality has been transferred to 
              pysas.print_sas_version()

- write_version.py: write_version.py and */write_version.py files have been removed since 
                    they cannot be used by the end user.

+ obsid     : obsid.py introduced. Replaces odfcontrol.
              Significant changes to pySAS. New class: ObsID

+ parser.py : Update documentation, add logger to ParseArgs, changed 'taskparser' to 
              'optparser'.

+ param.py  : Update documentation, add logger to paramXmlInfoReader.
